        <p> 2.Gambling / Betting </p> </div> 
            <p>is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as "the stakes") on an event with an uncertain outcome,with the primary intent of winning money or material goods.Gambling thus requires three elements to be present:consideration (an amount wagered),risk (chance),and a prize.[1] The outcome of the wager is often immediate,such as a single roll of dice,a spin of a roulette wheel,or a horse crossing the finish line,but longer time frames are also common,allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.
